This is a Stretched Grid Poisson Solver which uses the method of
a three point Langrange Interpolating Polynomial to approximate
the second partial derivatives of a function on a stretched grid.

for Unequal Sub-Intervals Using Lagrange's Interpolation Formula."
Int. Journal of Math. Analysis, Vol. 3, 2009, no 17, 815-827.

The solution can then be solved for iteratively using the method
of Jacobi relaxation.
